## Summary
- From this analysis, it is seen that the majority of ride users in NYC are the male demographic where the rides typically are conducted during early morning, and evening with the majority of rides being withing the 0-10 minute range. New York City is known for it urban environment, and density where riding bikes is an attractive alternative to car riding due to the congested traffic. 
- This business may be attractive in NYC due to car traffic, ease of use/accessibility of bikes, and short commute routes. This may not be the same for Des Moines, and where there is different factors that come to play as well as a whole different city layout, and density. More analysis on Des Moines would need to be taken, to further see if this is a viable business proposal, however, this analysis does provide some insight on Citi Bike service, and customers. 

Suggestions:
- Common routes bikers use.
-  Usertype by gender to have a deeper knowledge on the difference between genders, and usage. This information can be good for targeted campaigns
- A visualization showing the correlation between bike repair, and utilization as well as a visualization of number of bikes stolen, and cost of replacement.
