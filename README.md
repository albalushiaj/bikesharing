# bikesharing

how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August? Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
